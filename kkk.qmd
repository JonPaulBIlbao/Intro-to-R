## Learning R language

This document shows you the basics of using R programming.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
variable1 <- 6+145

# Basic objects
# ==========
x <- c(2, 4 , 6, 8)
x




# Vectors
# ==========
xNum  <- c(1, 3.14159, 5, 7)
xNum
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
